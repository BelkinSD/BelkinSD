Hi, I’m Stanislav 👋

I’m moving from industrial automation and B2B engineering into software QA and test automation.

🔍 I’m interested in:
– web & API testing
– practical test automation (Python / JS, Selenium / Playwright)
– reliability of complex, data-driven systems

🧰 Background: 10+ years working with industrial instrumentation, complex projects and stakeholders – now applying the same systematic thinking to software quality.

🌍 Open to remote collaboration.
